This returns information about the currently logged in user. If there is no logged in user
then there really wont be much information to show.

This does not process impersonation data. Avoid using the API in products that support impersonation.

user(accountId: ID!): User
Given an account id this will return user profile information with applied privacy controls of the caller.

Its important to remember that privacy controls are applied in terms of the caller. A user with
a certain accountId may exist but the current caller may not have the right to view their details.

Given a list of account ids this will return user profile information with applied privacy controls of the caller.

Its important to remember that privacy controls are applied in terms of the caller. A user with
a certain accountId may exist but the current caller may not have the right to view their details.

A maximum of 90 accountIds can be asked for at the one time.

identity_groupsByIds(ids: [ID!]!): [IdentityGroup!]

appLogs() returns an object for paging over AppLog objects, each of which
represents one invocation of a function.

The returned objects use the Relay naming/nesting style of
AppLogConnection → [AppLogEdge] → AppLog.

It takes parameters (query: LogQueryInput) to narrow down the invocations
being searched, requiring at least an app and environment.

invocation's log lines, given by the invocation parameter (an ID
returned from a appLogs() query).

Each AppLogLine consists of a timestamp, an optional message,
an optional level, and an other field that contains any
additional JSON fields included in the log line. (Since
the app itself can control the schema of this JSON, we can't
use native GraphQL capabilities to describe the fields here.)

The returned objects use the Relay naming/nesting style of
AppLogLineConnection → [AppLogLineEdge] → AppLogLine.
